So far, I have learned the basics of computer programming, including what a computer is and how it functions, specifically through its processor (CPU) and memory (RAM). I've also gained an understanding of programming as the process of creating instructions for a computer to follow, breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks.

Additionally, I've learned about the differences between compilers and interpreters. Python is an interpreted language that reads and executes code line by line, making it portable across different platforms.
