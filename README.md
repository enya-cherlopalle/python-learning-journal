About Me
Hi! My name is Enya Cherlopalle. I was born in Austin, Texas, but moved to the Bay Area when I was 7 years old. I am currently studying Econometrics and Quantitative Economics with minors in Computer Science and Business at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. During my studies in Illinois, I have learned Java and C++. I started learning Python this summer but decided to take a class on it this semester. 

Goals for This Course
I want to be fluent in Python and able to answer any question. I also want to use my logic skills to solve any problem.

My First Python Program
print("Hello, World!")
